# Practice with xrenner

I tried to modify the standard Udx Xrenner model to make a coreference resolution for _azazel.conllu_ file (a summary of Boris Akunin's "Azazel" novel, _azazel.txt_). Unfortunately, I did not succeed by adding entities and coref. rules as it was said in practical instructions and documentation -- nothing had been changing in my _azazel.html_ file comparing to the standard model output. So I have nothing meaningful to upload into the practical folder. I ran out of my time doing this practical, sorry :(
